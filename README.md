# Normal Mode
1) Files displayed alphabetically
2) Scrolling : 1 file scrolled aa a time. 'l' for scrolling down, 'k' for scrolling up.
3) Opening files : in their default apps (as discussed in MS-Teams)
4) Back and forward implemented same as we observe in Linux GUI file explorer app
5) Assumed : application home = CWD (if path was not given) = given path (if given) while running the program.

# Command Mode
1) If changes are made in current dir (shown currently on terminal), the changes would be updated (on terminal) when user comes out of the command mode by pressing ESC.
2) Goto would update the terminal with new path immediately.
3) All paths would be relative to Application home.
